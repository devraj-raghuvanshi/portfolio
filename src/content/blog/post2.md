In the project titled "Attention-Aware Deep Architecture for Multi-Modal Sarcasm Detection," the focus is on developing a robust model for detecting sarcasm in multimodal data.

To extract features from the different modalities, I've utilized various transformer-based pre-trained models.

I've implemented early and late fusion strategies, obtaining some baseline results. Moving forward, the next steps in the project involve the design and implementation of a deep learning architecture with attention-based mechanisms. Attention mechanisms allow the model to focus on relevant information within each modality, enhancing the model's ability to detect sarcasm effectively. By incorporating attention mechanisms, the model can learn to prioritize important features while ignoring irrelevant or noisy information.

Additionally, the project is exploring the incorporation of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) into the architecture. GNNs have shown promising results in various tasks involving structured data, such as social network analysis and recommendation systems. By leveraging GNNs, the model can potentially capture complex relationships and dependencies within and between different modalities, further improving the performance of sarcasm detection in multimodal data.

The project aims to develop a state-of-the-art deep learning architecture with attention-based mechanisms and potentially GNNs for multi-modal sarcasm detection, thereby advancing the capabilities of sarcasm detection models in understanding and interpreting multimodal content effectively.
